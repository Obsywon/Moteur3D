# How to install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Obsywon/Moteur3D.git
cd ./build
cmake ..
make
```

# How to use:
The basic command will output a default image based on the obj/african_head folder :

./renderer

```

To output another image, add the path to an .obj file. For example:
```bash
./renderer "../obj/diablo3_pose/diablo3_pose/obj"

```
